Thanks for purchasing my pack!

In this pack you will find a collection of short orchestral clips, useful for perfect for win and lose situations. There are also a big "Ta Da" sound, in two variations (normal and dissonant) and two rising orchestral "clusters".


Feel free to write me if you use it in your project (matteo@alchemystudio.it).

If you can, I will also appreciate the name in the credits and a link to my website (www.alchemystudio.it)

Who am I?

I’m an independent musician and composer, dealing with a lot of different generes of music, from rock to soundtrack, from ambient to children’s lullabies . The feelings expressed by my music varies a lot from romance and love to epic fantasy, from thriller and horror to hope and joy.

I’m a guitarist, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist, with an experimental attitude. I have plenty of exotic instruments collected around the world (indian sitar, chinese erhu, dizi and guzheng, turkish saz, etc) and I like to combine them with samples and synth sounds from the PC, as well experimenting with sound design, unusual, and custom build instruments. 

Please help me to reach your needs: if you buy my music, I will be very happy to know how did you find me and why did you choose my items. I am also really interested to know how did you use my music, and I will keep all the informations strictly confidential: so feel free to send me an email. 


Best wishes,
