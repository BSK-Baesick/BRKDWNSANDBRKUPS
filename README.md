Dive into a thrilling world of ARCADE as the RHYTHM starts to beat in the iconic songs of all times. In BRKDWNS&BRKUPS, you follow the storyline of a man and a woman who falls in love with each other through music.

TAP, SWIPE or even SMASH the BEATz according to the gesture given on the screen to earn EMOpoints. 

Unleash your creativity by making your own levels at the LEVEL CREATOR using the SONGS in your OWN PLAYLIST at SPOTIFY, find friends with the same music taste as you during the MIX&MATCH sessions, share your stories and art at the community in the DISCOVER SECTION, dethrone players around the globe in the JAMMING ROOM and make your way through the HALL OF FAME to become the VIRTUOSO.

NEVER PAY TO WIN! Your arsenals and resources depends on your skills and how you socialized with other peeps in-game. MORE SOCIAL POINTS = MORE POWER!

So, do you have what it takes to become the GRANDOISE VIRTUOSO?
